                Abibas is a humorous name often used online to describe the Adidas company with a misspelling. In
                reality, Abibas is not an official brand or company. It is simply a popular internet meme based on the
                incorrect spelling of the Adidas name.

                Important: Abibas is not a real company, but a joke based on a misspelling of Adidas.
